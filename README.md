# Vision
Our vision is to supply our target organisations with lab transparency. That means easy store, search and
find sample and reagent locations, stress-less project material handover, sharing of common 
reagents and log-records of sample movements. 

# Project 
This project is under development and currently published for alpha testing phase. 
Requirement engineering, function design and testing is aligned with researchers from 
the [University of Cambridge](https://www.path.cam.ac.uk/).  

# Technology
This app is designed as a web service to be used independent of the operating system and web browser. 
In this project phase target devices are PCs and Laptops. Mobile device support is under development.

# GxP
Turtle-lab is intending to meet GxP requirements for working with clinical samples.
